# FPGA-Game
 This was an academic project in which I had to use a FPGA board do drive an interesting project.
 I decided then to create a simple game in VHDL, what for sure required the management with the connection with a VGA screen and with the NES controllers so we could play, in the same time it was needed the creation of all the logic inside the game. 
 The language used was VHDL, so it was interesting to see the control of each part of the system, even with all the limitations imposed for this kind of project.
